        <div class="col-sm">  <p>On the border between Namibia and Angola, in the region known as Kaokoland, you’ll find Epupa Falls. These waterfalls are created by the Kunene River, and they are spread out over a mile. Surrounding the falls are colored rock formations, palm trees and fig trees. Although Epupa Falls is remote and only accessible by 4×4 vehicles, it remains a popular attraction in Namibia. Most travelers who visit Epupa Falls opt to stay overnight in one of the surrounding lodges. If you want to add some adrenaline to your day, you can also try out some whitewater rafting along the river.</p></div>
